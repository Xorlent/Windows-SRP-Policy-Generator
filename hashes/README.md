### hashes .csv source files
- This folder includes hash data for some commonly abused LOL executables that a typical corporate user should not be running.  
- To create your own hash file, all colums must be populated or the SRP will not function.  The script will ignore entries with missing or incpomplete data.
![IMPORTANT]
> Have a list of other LOL executables to block and want to share with the security community?
  > Create a pull request to add .csv files to this list!
