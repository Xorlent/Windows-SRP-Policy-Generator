### hashes .csv source files
- This folder includes hash data for some commonly abused LOL executables that a typical corporate user should not be running.  
- To create your own hash file, all colums must be populated or the SRP will not function.
  - The Create-SRPPolicy script will ignore entries with missing or incpomplete data.
> [!NOTE]
> Have a list of other LOL executables to block and want to share with the security community?  Create a pull request to add .csv files to this list!
